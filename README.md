Notes:

This project uses Lombok. In a few words, it's a compiler enhancement that shortens some Java constructs by means of 
special annotations. For instance, @Getter private int foo; automatically generates a public int getFoo() getter method.
This requires some interaction with the IDE so it doesn't complain about syntax errors.

* If you work with NetBeans 7.3 and later, you don't need anything.

* If you work with Eclipse, you need to install the Lombok plugin as explained at http://projectlombok.org

* If you work with Android Studio, you need to go to File / Settings (Preferences on Mac OS X), go to the Plugin tab and
  install the Lombok plugin. You also need to go to the Compiler Settings, tab "Annotation Processors" and check
  "Enable annotation processors".
